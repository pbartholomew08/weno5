This repository is an exploration of literate programming to develop a fortran
module implementing the weno5 finite difference scheme for xcompact3d.

The included output files can be generated by tangling the weno.org file using
emacs with org-mode 9.

After generating output files run make to build the python module, you can then
run the tests as:

python weno-test.py
python test-adv.py

to generate the output figures.
Exporting the weno.org to pdf from emacs will then generate the weno.tex file
and weno.pdf including the figures of the test results.

REQUIREMENTS:
- emacs 25+ with orgmode version 9
- gfortran (other Fortran compilers untested but should work)
- python 2
- numpy with f2py
- scipy
- matplotlib
